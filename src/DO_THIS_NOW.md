# ‚ö° DO THIS NOW - Blank Page Fix

## Your app is showing a blank page. Follow these EXACT steps:

---

## STEP 1: Stop the Server

In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:

**Press:** `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+C` (Mac)

**Or** close the terminal window.

---

## STEP 2: Open Terminal in Project Root

Make sure you're in the project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/dpres-disaster-preparedness
```

Verify you're in the right place:
```bash
ls
```

You should see: `package.json`, `App.tsx`, `index.html`

---

## STEP 3: Delete Everything

### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

### On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, package-lock.json
```

### On Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
```

---

## STEP 4: Clean npm Cache

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

Wait for it to finish. You should see:
```
npm cache verified
```

---

## STEP 5: Install Everything Fresh

```bash
npm install
```

‚è≥ **This will take 2-5 minutes.** Wait for it to complete.

You should see at the end:
```
added XXX packages in XXs
```

If you see any errors, run it again:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## STEP 6: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

---

## STEP 7: Open Browser

**Click the link in terminal** or manually go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Use the EXACT URL from your terminal!

---

## STEP 8: Check Result

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS - You should see:
- DPRES login page
- Orange, blue, and green colors
- "Student", "Institution Admin", "SDMA Admin Access" buttons
- Styled buttons and text
- No blank page!

### ‚ùå STILL BLANK? Check Console:

1. Press `F12` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac)
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for RED errors

---

## Common Errors & Quick Fixes

### Error: "Cannot find module 'motion/react'"

**Fix:**
```bash
npm install motion
npm run dev
```

### Error: "Failed to load PostCSS"

**Fix:** Check if `postcss.config.js` exists

If NOT, create it with this content:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
};
```

Then:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Error: "Tailwind is not defined"

**Fix:** Check first line of `styles/globals.css`

It MUST be:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

If not, add that as the VERY FIRST LINE.

Then:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Error: Port 5173 is already in use

**Fix:**
```bash
npx kill-port 5173
npm run dev
```

---

## Still Not Working?

### Nuclear Option (Last Resort):

```bash
# 1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Kill all Node processes
pkill node
# Or on Windows: Open Task Manager, end all Node.js processes

# 3. Delete EVERYTHING
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf dist
rm -rf .vite
rm package-lock.json

# 4. Clean cache aggressively
npm cache clean --force
npm cache verify

# 5. Reinstall
npm install

# 6. Try build first
npm run build

# 7. If build works, try dev
npm run dev
```

## What Was Wrong?

The blank page was caused by:

3. Wrong dependency versions

We've fixed all of these. The files have been updated.

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: add postcss config"
   git push
   ```
3. **Vercel will auto-deploy**
